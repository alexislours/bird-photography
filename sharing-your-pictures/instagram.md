# Instagram

Instagram is undeniably the most popular platform around.

While this big user base is handy to get feedback, it's also really hard to shine in front of other photographer due to the sheer amount of content.

If you photos are good it will most likely come down to luck and getting highlighted in the Discover page of Instagram.

To maximise visibility, avoid posting horizontal picture and use square or even 4:5 aspect ratios for an optimal screen real estate.
