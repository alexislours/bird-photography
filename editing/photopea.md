# Photopea

{% hint style="success" %}
Pros:

* Free
* Runs on any platform
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Cons:

* Limited RAW editing
* Not as feature complete as Photoshop
{% endhint %}

[Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) is an online site with a UI fairly similar to Photoshop which also allows basic RAW editing in the browser. 

It's a great alternative in case you only have a Chromebook or can't install software.
