### Introduction

This guide is a repository of my knowledge of bird photography.

Iâ€™m not a professional bird photographer, nor an ornithologist, but I feel like my experience without a background in either of these fields could be helpful to beginners.

The content will be biased on the way I view bird photography and thus you might not agree with some of the ideas in it.

{% hint style="info" %}
The reader is expected to be familiarised with the basics of photography and to know their own camera settings.
