# Where to find birds

Even after finding a popular birding spot, it can be hard to know where to look for birds.

### Ecotope borders

An [ecotope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecotope) is the smallest form of landscape. Wildlife is often abundant at its borders.

This can mean the edge of a forest, the borders of a body of water, a shore...  
It's often pointless to go deep in a forest as you'll most likely encounter a lot less birds.

### Bodies of water

Bodies of water attract birds and most kinds of wildlife, this makes it easy to find some there. Reeds are also a common hiding place for a lost of species.
