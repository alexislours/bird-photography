# Ethical bird photography

Most of the following rules are taken from [Audubon's guide](https://www.audubon.org/get-outside/audubons-guide-ethical-bird-photography) which is a great list of rules to follow. Not disturbing birds is primordial to me when taking pictures of them.

* Maintain a fair distance from the bird, if the bird flees, you are too close.
* When possible, stay behind cover as not to disturb the bird's activities.
* Do not share publicly the location of rare birds \(particularly owls\), this can cause a huge amount of people to show up.
* Do not use a flash at night, period. A flash can disorient an owl and temporarily blind it which could lead to its death. Parrots are also really affected by flash, even in daylight.
* Stay away from nests, this can scare the parents and kill the offspring.
* Do not lure birds with food, this can cause them to expose themselves and get attacked or simply to become dependant on you.
* Do not playback calls to a bird, this can cause unnecessary stress to territorial birds and other species nearby.
