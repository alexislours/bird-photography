# Finding a good birding place

When starting, knowing where to look for birds can be though. The truth is, you can find many different species of birds pretty much everywhere in the world.

The best way to find spots around you is to use reporting sites like [iNaturalist](../external-ressources/inaturalist.md) and [eBird](../external-ressources/ebird.md), both of which have maps for sightings.

Another method for finding spots is simply talking to other birders, be it online or at the places you find around you.
