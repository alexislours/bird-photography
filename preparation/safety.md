# Safety

Staying safe is the most important part when going out to take pictures. The following recommendation can greatly improve your safety on the field.

### Stay on the trail

When going in national park or any remote areas, try to stick as much as possible to the trail. 

Going out of it can be a risk for from the terrain on top of disturbing locale fauna. Risks of fall, getting bitten by ticks or simply lost are a lot greater outside of marked path.

### Carry water

When going on longer trails, always carry a bottle of water and food. This can seem trivial but it could save you from a heat stroke.

### Take a monopod

When going out in public parks, especially in the afternoon, carrying a monopod can prevent a lot of unwanted encounters with thieves. Having something solid like a monopod can also have other uses like removing spider webs at observatories.
