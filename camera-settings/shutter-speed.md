# Shutter speed

Shutter speed or the speed at which your camera takes a picture is one of the most important settings of bird photography.

The general rule of thumb is that your shutter speed should be at a minimum equal to $$1/length$$when handheld. So you should strive for a minimum of$$1/600$$when using a 600mm lens,$$1/300$$with a 300mm lens... 

You can go much lower when using a tripod but you have to keep in mind that birds move and thus going at too low of a shutter speed with cause your pictures to become blurry.

For birds in flight, a$$1/800$$shutter speed is often considered a minimum, with $$1/1600$$being considered optimal for most birds. You might need to go faster with specific birds like hummingbirds.
