description: RAW or JPEG?

# Image format

RAW and JPEG are the two options for the format of your pictures.

### JPEG

JPEG is a lossy image format, this means that part of the information that your camera sensor captured has been lost while creating the file.

This causes the files to be smaller, but also makes editing very restricted.

### RAW

Unlike JPEG, RAW are a lot flexible as they include more information in the file.

This allows to [edit](../editing/editing.md) your pictures with minimal quality loss.

You can also shot in RAW + JPEG if you truly need JPEG files for quick sharing.
