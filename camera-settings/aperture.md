# Aperture

Aperture define how wide your lens is open. The lower the number, the more light gets to the sensor.

Most zoom lenses have a typical aperture of$$f/6.3$$or$$f/5.6$$at their widest.  
For greater sharpness, it is usually recommended to go down one stop or two third of a stop when light conditions allow it. This would mean taking an$$f/5.6$$down to $$f/7.1$$or$$f/8$$and an$$f/6.3$$lens down to$$f/8$$or$$f/9$$.
