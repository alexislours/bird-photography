# Binoculars

Lighter than your camera, binoculars can allow you to take a quick look around without taking out your camera gear.

This can be very handy to identify a species or simply try to find a bird.

Much like cameras, prices for binoculars can vary a fair bit.

Audubon already made [a great guide](https://www.audubon.org/gear/binocular-guide) for binoculars that will probably give you better explanations and options than I can.
