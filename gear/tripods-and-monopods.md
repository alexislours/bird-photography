# Tripods and monopods

Tripods and monopods aren't essential for bird photography, I personally almost never use them. It entirely depends on the way you want to approach the field. I personally prefer walking over settling at a single spot.

{% hint style="info" %}
While I do not use them, I recommend getting a monopod for the reasons highlighted in [Safety](../preparation/safety.md).

### Tripods

Tripods are great if you are going to stay at a single spot for a bird to land on a perch. Not as portable as monopods, they offer a great stability.

### Monopods

Lighter than tripods, they are easier to fit in a [bag](bag.md) or simply carry by hand. Unless you buy a tripod head to mount of them, they also severely suffer from a lack of adaptability if you need to track a target going up and down.
